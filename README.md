what distinguishes people that improve from people that do not improve
possible determinants:
personal characteristics
network characteristics
class-number
cluster them on all possible characteristics
combination of above: first cluster, then apply learning
are people that are selected via the algorithm, also found in some cluster

SP1 addresses the first key objective, investigating the most effective ways to identify
peer influencers in OSNs. Specifically, this SP will develop a method for peer-influencer
identification based on OSN communications (i.e., CBP), considering both influentiality
likelihood and influence-activity likelihood (see Figure 1). Peer influencers are considered
central to social network campaigning, and a variety of identification strategies have
been proposed99. This subproject will investigate how peer influencers can be identified
and targeted based on the network of OSN communications, taking into account the
content and strength of peer-to-peer communications. (e.g., relevance and frequency of
interaction).
Importantly, SP1 adopts a social network analytical approach, relying on ABMs of
network dynamics and network diffusion100-101, including the variety of indicators of
influentiality likelihood and influence-activity likelihood. The subproject will be advised by
leading experts in network dynamics and computational ABM from VU Amsterdam with
whom we already have conducted pilot studies to prepare for the proposed Vici project
(see Local, national and international collaborations). The key objective of SP1 will be
addressed in the following four steps (for methodological details see section Methods:
Four research steps).
SP1.1 Revealing mechanisms. First, SP1 will analyze the dataset of observational
OSN communications to explore the validity of various communication-based
identification strategies. Specifically, this involves comparing strategies for identification
of networks (i.e., based on content and strength of interactions) and peer influencers
(e.g., based on network position or influence maximization102), using previously validated
peer-nominated social network methodology as a benchmark103 and behavioral outcome
measures as predictive criterion. Based on the conceptual framework, questions to be
addressed are: (RQ1) How do communication-based networks varying in content and
strength represent influentiality likelihood and influence-activity likelihood? and (RQ2)
How do various peer-influencer identification methodologies represent influentiality
likelihood and influence-activity likelihood?
